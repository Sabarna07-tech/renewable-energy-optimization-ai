# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately so we can address it quickly.

- Email: security@energy-load-forecasting.org
- Alternatively, open a private advisory via the GitHub Security tab.

Please include the following information:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
- A minimal proof of concept if available.
- The affected versions or configurations.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours, work with you on a fix, and credit you in the release notes if desired.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest `main` branch. When tags are published, the most recent minor release remains supported.
